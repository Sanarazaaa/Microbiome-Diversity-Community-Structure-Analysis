# Microbiome-Diversity-Community-Structure-Analysis
An R-based pipeline for processing microbial abundance datasets, computing diversity metrics (Shannon index, Bray–Curtis PCoA, rank–abundance curves), and visualizing community composition via bar plots and heatmaps. Includes reproducible code for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and multi-panel figure generation.
